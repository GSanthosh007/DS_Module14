# Ex2(B) Priority Queue
## DATE:06-09-2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1.	Start
2.	Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3.	Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4.	Print each element of the array during the loop.
5.	After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.
6.	End

## Program:

#include<stdio.h>

int size = 0;

void printArray(int array[], int size)
{
int i;
for(i=0;i<size;i++)
{
printf("%d ",array[i]);
}
printf("\n");
}
